# Running App.js with Express.js using Nodemon

This README.md file provides instructions on how to run the `app.js` file, which utilizes Express.js, with Nodemon for automatic server restarts upon file changes.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - JavaScript runtime environment
- [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) - Utility that monitors for changes in files and automatically restarts the server

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Nyx1on/Snapify-backend.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd <project-directory>
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Configuration

No additional configuration is required. However, you may adjust settings in `app.js` according to your needs.

## Usage

To start the server, run the following command:

```bash
npm start
